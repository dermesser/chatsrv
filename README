README for chatsrv

chatsrv is a concurrent chat server with a cross-platform protocol.

It is written in Erlang with an extensive usage of Mnesia and concurrency.

The concurrency model looks like this:

Way of a message
****************

[Client (e.g. written in C)]
	--Network-->
		[EProcess associated with the client]
			---EMessage--->
				[Channel Eprocess]
			---EMessage--->
		[EProcess associated with other client]
	--Network-->
[Client]


Mnesia is used to store the channels (channels are a number from 0 - 2^64) and which users are in them,
and the users itselves.
