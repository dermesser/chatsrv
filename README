README for chatsrv

chatsrv is a concurrent chat server with a cross-platform protocol.

It is written in Erlang with an extensive usage of Mnesia and concurrency.

The concurrency model looks like this:

Way of a message
****************

EProcess: Erlang process
EMessage: Erlang message passing message

[Client (e.g. written in C)]
	--Network-->
		[EProcess associated with the client]
			---EMessage--->
				[Channel EProcess]
			---EMessage--->
		[EProcess associated with other client]
	--Network-->
[Client]


Run the Server
****************

To get the server up and running, first compile the source code files:

$ erlc *.erl

Then start the server and say it to create a new schema (it's equal if there is one
or not):

$ erl -s chatsrv main true

Now chatsrv should be listening on 32768/tcp4.

Test the server
****************

Either write your own client in any language supporting sockets and
basic byte manipulation or use the client examples provided in here.

For the examples to work, you have to install libsocket first. (https://github.com/dermesser/libsocket)
It's also a good idea to change the hardcoded IP address in the clients.

* client.c takes input on STDIN and sends it as messages to the channel 45
* client2.c takes messages on the network socket and puts them on STDOUT
* client3.c is similar to client2.c, but receives only one message and exits.

If a client gets killed (Ctrl+C etc), the associated user is removed in chatsrv, so you
may start and stop the same client several times (user name is hardcoded).
